# 1. Create a string and print its length using the len() function.
my_string = "commission"
print(len(my_string))

# 2. Create two strings, concatenate them, and print the resulting
# string.
word1 = "bat"
word2 = "man"
print(f"{word1}{word2}")

# 3. Create two string variables, then print one of them after the other
# (with a space added in between) using a comma in your print statement.
first = "Kenneth"
last = "Barrett"
print(f"{first},{last}")

# 4. Repeat exercise 3, but instead of using commas in print(), use concatenation
# to add a space between the two strings.
print(f"{first} {last}")
# 5. Print the string "zing" by using subscripts and index numbers on
# the string "bazinga" to specify the correct range of characters.
print("bazinga"[2:6])
