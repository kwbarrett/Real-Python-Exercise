# 1. Write a script that creates the two variables, num1 and num2. Both
# num1 and num2 should be assigned the integer literal 25,000,000,
# one written with underscored and one without. Print num1 and num2
# on two separate lines.

num1 = 25000000
num2 = 25_000_000

print(num1)
print(num2)

# 2. Write a script that creates assigns the floating-point literal 175000.0
# to the variable num using exponential notation, and then prints num
# in the interactive window.

num = 17.5e4
print(num)

# 3. In the interactive window, try and find the the smallest exponent N
# so that 2e<N>, where <N> is replaced with your number, returns inf.
